Ravenous 

The app allows a user to search for businesses by city, state, and or zipcode and filter the results based on: best match, rating, or most reviewed. After inputting a name to search and a location, the app will return a list of businesses that match the inputs based on the filter. 

After finishing the app, I deployed it to AWS. This link will take you to the full web-application: https://master.d1hb41ipbo4fob.amplifyapp.com/ . 

This app is built on ReactJS. I am satisfied with how it turned out and I think it is a great start to learning React. Now that I am done, I obviously see things that I would do differently. One immediate thing that I would fix is adding validation for types of searches. Right now the app will return any business type, not just restaurants. It seems a bit odd that an app built for searching restaurants will return results featuring mechanic businesses... if the user searches for it. 

Another fix that I would implement would be to fix the whitespace below the search bar. When the page is initially loaded, to me, the blank space is awkward. I would change the searchbar to take up the whole screen and then adjust the sizing after a search is executed and the restaurant components are rendered.

I completed this project from the Codecademy React course to learn and apply the fundamentals of React.
